getting error:
env: ecmts
operation: eCMTSversionupgrade
TARGET_HOST is set to ecmts_server
ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  found unknown escape character
The error appears to be in '/home/gitlab-runner/builds/VuRVMFqH/0/hmno-devops/wireline-infra-automation/scripts/eCMTSversionupgradetest.yml': line 10, column 50, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.
The offending line appears to be:
    dest: /home/silver/
    rpm_file_regex: "eCMTS-{{ eCMTS_version }}-.*\.rpm"
                                                 ^ here
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
missing quotes. Always quote template expression brackets when they
start a value. For instance:
    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}
Should be written as:
    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"

here is the code:
---
- name: Fetch and print RPM file from Artifactory
  hosts: "{{ target_host }}"
  become: yes
  vars:
    url: "{{ artifactory_release_path }}"
    url_username: "{{ artifactory_user }}"
    url_password: "{{ artifactory_password }}"
    dest: /home/silver/
    rpm_file_regex: "eCMTS-{{ eCMTS_version }}-.*\.rpm"
 
  tasks:
    - name: Get list of files in RPM directory

        method: GET
        user: "{{ artifactory_user }}"
        password: "{{ artifactory_password }}"

    - name: Fail if no RPM file is found
      fail:
        msg: "No RPM file found matching the pattern {{ rpm_file_regex }} in the directory eCMTS_{{eCMTS_version }}"
      when: rpm_file is not defined
 
    - name: Download RPM file from Artifactory
      get_url:
        url: "{{ artifactory_release_path }}/eCMTS_{{ eCMTS_version }}/{{ rpm_file }}"
        dest: "/home/silver/{{ rpm_file }}"
        url_username: "{{ artifactory_user }}"

      debug:

please correct and provide the code
