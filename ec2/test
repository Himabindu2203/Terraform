Requurement below:
task 1 - check if watcher is running on all VMs. 
task 2 - start watcher wherever is not running

i have already piece of code below:

---
- name: Upgrade eCMTS version 
  hosts: "{{ target_host }}"
  become: yes
  tasks:

    - name: Check for running watcher process on all servers
      shell: ps -ef | grep eCMTS_watcher.sh
      register: watcher_processes
      ignore_errors: true
      failed_when: false
     
    - name: Print the running watcher processes on all servers
      debug:
        msg: "{{ watcher_processes.stdout if watcher_processes.stdout else 'No watcher process running' }}"

so, we have to start the watcher if it is not running.please update the code and share to me.
